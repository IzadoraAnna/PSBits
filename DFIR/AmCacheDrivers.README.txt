# The script scans AmCache looking for entries related to drivers marked as not being part of Windows. Includes drivers loaded in the past.
# At the end id displays the data through Out-GridView which makes it "ISE Only". Feel free to export $sarr any other method.
# Must run as admin.
# If you want to know more about AmCache - refer to the excellent document by @moustik01: https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/publication/amcache-analysis/

# The script itself:

Creates working folder,
Creates a snapshot of the drive,
Mounts snapshot as a folder,
Loads AmCache from the snapshot as the Registry hive,
Digs for juicy data.
# Steps 1-4 will remain the same if you want to dig for any other data collected within AmCache. Feel free to modify the script according to your needs.

# The script does not perform any cleanup. To do so:


Write down the $myguid value
Close ISE
cmd.exe -> reg unload HKLM\{guid}
cmd.exe -> rd c:\{guid}\shadowcopy
cmd.exe -> rd c:\{guid}
cmd.exe -> vssadmin list shadows
Find the GUID after "Shadow Copy ID:" (and NOT the one after "shadow copy set ID:")
cmd.exe -> vssadmin delete shadows /shadow={guid-from-the-step-above}
